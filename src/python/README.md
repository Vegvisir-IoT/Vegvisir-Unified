# Vegvisir
Abstractâ€”While the intersection of blockchains and the In- ternet of Things
(IoT) have received considerable research  interest lately, Nakamoto-style
blockchains possess a number of qualities that make them poorly suited for many
IoT scenarios. Specificially, they require high network connectivity and are
power-intensive. This is a drawback in IoT environments where
battery-constrained nodes form an unreliable ad hoc network such as in digital
agriculture.


## Set-up
**Dependencies:** Python3, python3-tk
Code written to perform on Linux OS. Therefore, some of simulations utilizing
Tkinter package may operate differently.

## Set-up for Container Usage
Ensure you are running the appropriate container.
**Container:** dadams39/vegvisir [docker]
- To install packages: pip install -e .
